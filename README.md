# Hinglish Conversation Classifier

This repository contains the implementation of a Hinglish Conversation Classifier. The notebook demonstrates how to build a classifier for Hinglish conversations, focusing on the classification of text into three categories: `normal`, `toxic`, and `catfish`. The objective of building such a model is to help detect and stop catfishing and toxic conversations across social media platforms. Due to the recent rise in such events, which have led to monetary loss, depression, and other negative impacts, there is a growing need for automated tools to report and mitigate these harmful interactions. The process includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying Hinglish text. This project aims to address the challenges posed by the bilingual and code-switching nature of Hinglish, which makes it difficult for traditional language models and classifiers to handle effectively. 

## Project Overview

The project is structured to guide you through the development and deployment of the Hinglish Conversation Classifier. The main components of the project include:

1. **Data Preparation**: 
    - The dataset used for training and testing the model is a collection of Hinglish text samples. 
    - Text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, and handling of code-switched text are implemented to prepare the data for model training.

2. **Model Development**:
    - The project explores various machine learning and deep learning models suitable for text classification, including but not limited to:
      - Logistic Regression
      - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
      - Random Forest
      - LSTM/GRU-based Recurrent Neural Networks
      - Transformer-based models like BERT
    - Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation are conducted to select the best-performing model.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
    - The classifier's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
    - Cross-validation is employed to ensure the model's robustness and generalization to unseen data.

4. **Deployment**:
    - The final model is saved and made ready for deployment in a production environment.
    - The repository includes a script for deploying the model as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI.

5. **Results and Analysis**:
    - The results section contains an analysis of the classifier's performance, along with any insights gained during the project.
    - A comparison between different models and their respective performance metrics is presented.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hinglish-Conversation-Classifier.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd Hinglish-Conversation-Classifier
    ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
    - Install the required Python packages using `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

After setting up the environment, you can start using the Hinglish Conversation Classifier:

1. **Training the Model**:
    - Run the Jupyter notebook or the provided Python script to train the model:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
    - Modify the script or notebook as needed to adjust parameters or change models.

2. **Evaluating the Model**:
    - Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset:
    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py
    ```

3. **Deploying the Model**:
    - To deploy the model as an API:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    - The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000/` by default.

4. **Making Predictions**:
    - Use the deployed API or a script to make predictions on new Hinglish text samples.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project has been uploaded and is crucial for both training and evaluating the Hinglish Conversation Classifier. It was generated by providing prompts to ChatGPT-4, reflecting real-life scenarios, and using a personal dataset as the foundation.
